/**
   World operates as a structure that holds all the rigidbodies with a simulation. From within
   this class the appropriate methods are called to keep track of and update the rigidbodies.
   
   The core implementation of the class is applyPhysics(), of which runs through a list of
   methods that result in the application of physics to the objects.
   
   Every frame five key steps are undertaken:

   1. By running clearAccumulatedForces() for each shape in shapes the forces that it
   accumulated in the last frame are cleared.
   2. Run updateForces() to calculate the forces to be applied to each shape in this frame.
   3. Call integrate() to update the position and velocity of each shape according to its
   acceleration and the forces applied on it in step 1.
   4. With the forces applied we run generateContacts() to check if there are now any collisions
   between the shapes.
   5. If there are any contacts then these collisions are passed to ShapeContactResolver where
   resolveContacts() appropriate applies forces to resolve any interpenetrations.

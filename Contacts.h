   is resolved by applying an impulse force to separate them, taking into account the mass of each object, and the

/**
   ShapeContactResolver applies impulse force to objects to simulate collisions. A list of contacts is received
   and passed into the resolveContacts() method. resolveContacts() generates an impulse force which changes ONLY
   the velocity of each shape in collision, and not the acceleration. To generalise, the following actions are
   taken (for step-by-step pseudo-code see comment above resolveContacts()):

   1. Checks are conducted to ensure that objects are not resting but actually colliding.
   2. For those that are colliding impulse is applied to shapes in contact to simulate them bouncing apart.
   2. Any interpenetrating objects are moved apart.

   One ShapeContactResolver instance is shared for whole system.
   The maximum number of contacts ShapeContactResolver will resolve in a single frame is dictated by maxIterations.

  /**
     For the list of contacts passed they are iterated on and their contacts resolved to remove penetration, and apply
     impulse force. The working is as follows:
     
     1. Calculate the separating velocity of each contact, and hold the contact with the strongest separating force.
     2. If this value is above 0 it is already moving away, and there is/are no collisions to be dealt with. Return.
     3. If there are collisions to be resolved, the ShapeContact method resolve() is called on the contact found in
        step 1, and the contact is resolved by adding impulse to remove any interpenetration.
     4. Repeat from step 1 until all collisions are resolved.

     The approach taken in this method repeatedly examines the entire list of collisions, even after a collision has
     been resolved. This is undertaken as the resolution of a collision may well create movement that creates yet
     another contact. The maximum number of times this method will loop is limited at the value of maxIteration.
